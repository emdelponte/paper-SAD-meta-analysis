% Data



The data were organized in a Google sheet file which can be read directly using the *gsheet* package. Let's create the dataset and name it as `dataws`. 

Let's have a quick look at the dataset.

```{r}
data <- gsheet::gsheet2tbl("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oBa_OIko04157D0-Z0tV7dN8BJxq9fAjEfbOkoSKy5s/edit?usp=sharing", sheetid = "all-data")
data

```


```{r}
dplyr::glimpse(data)

```
